# Hello World: Building My First Website with Claude Code

This is my first post, and fittingly, it's about how this very website came to be.

## A Mind-Blowing Experience

Playing around with Claude Code and being able to publish my first website without even opening an IDE or laptop has been a mind-blowing, perspective-altering experience. As someone who's been obsessed with AI for coding and communication, seeing this level of capability in action is truly remarkable.

## Why This Matters

Ever since I experienced SQL autocompletion in my query editor, I've been fascinated by how AI can improve productivity at work. But Claude Code takes this to an entirely different level. It's not just about autocomplete anymore—it's about having a collaborator that can:

- Understand high-level requirements
- Make architectural decisions
- Write production-ready code
- Handle the entire development lifecycle

## What I Learned

Building this site taught me that we're entering a new era of software development. The barrier to entry is lower than ever, and the speed at which ideas can become reality is accelerating.

I've put this site together to share random thoughts and ideas on AI topics mainly. This is just the beginning.

## Next Steps

I'm excited to explore more of what's possible with AI-assisted development and share my learnings along the way. Stay tuned for more posts on AI, coding, and the future of work.

Thanks for reading!
