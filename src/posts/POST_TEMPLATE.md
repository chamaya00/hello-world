## Tips for Adding a New Post:

1. **Copy this template file** to create your new post
2. **Rename the file** to something like `my-new-post.md`
3. **Update the frontmatter** (the stuff between the --- lines at top):
   - title: Your post title
   - date: Today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - author: Your name
   - tags: Categories/topics (in quotes, comma-separated)
   - excerpt: One sentence summary
4. **Replace this content** with your actual post
5. **Save the file** - that's it! The site will automatically find it!

## Pasting Content from Other Sources:

- From Word/Google Docs: Copy/paste will mostly work, but you may need to clean up formatting
- From websites: Copy the text and add markdown formatting as needed
- From plain text: Just paste it and add ## for headings
