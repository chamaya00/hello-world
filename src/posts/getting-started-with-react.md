# Getting Started with React in 2025

React has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. Whether you're building a simple personal website or a complex web application, React provides the tools you need to create dynamic, responsive experiences.

## Why React?

React's component-based architecture makes it easy to:

- **Reuse code** across your application
- **Manage state** efficiently
- **Build complex UIs** from simple, isolated pieces
- **Think declaratively** about your UI

## Your First Component

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
}
```

This functional component takes a `name` prop and returns a greeting. Simple, clean, and reusable.

## Key Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. You can think of them as custom HTML elements that encapsulate logic and presentation.

### Props

Props allow you to pass data from parent components to child components, making your code modular and flexible.

### State

State allows components to create and manage their own data. When state changes, React automatically re-renders the component.

## Next Steps

Once you understand these core concepts, you can explore:

1. React Hooks for managing state and side effects
2. React Router for navigation
3. State management libraries like Redux or Zustand
4. Build tools like Vite for fast development

Happy coding!
