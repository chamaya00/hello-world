# Hello AI Coding World

The idea I asked Claude to code is this very website, and I was shocked when it took less than 20 minutes and literally two prompts for Claude to spit out a fully working first version for me. (Skip to the end if you want to see the prompts and try them out for yourself.) 

The rest of this post might sound like a promo for Claude Code, but full honesty I’m just a huge fan and super excited after my experience. 

At first I had been using Claude similarly to how I would use ChatGPT, starting up chat threads for different ideas. When I asked Claude to help me write code for a project idea, it would generate several artifacts or long responses containing huge blocks of code. 

This was so awesome and mind-blowing to see every single time; I couldn’t believe how easily this thing could write code. But it was still tricky getting the code to run — the best I could do at the time was open up Google Cloud Shell and copy paste from Claude into the cloud shell editor. This got more difficult when Claude would generate many files for a project, and even harder whenever there were issues to debug. 

One day I noticed and tapped on the </> Code section in the Claude app, and then the coding magic turned into real productivity. 

I wasn’t (and still not) super familiar with Github -- when Claude Code asked me to connect to Github and select a repo, I was a little stuck. Fortunately I had an old Hello World repo from a tutorial that I vaguely remembered doing years before, so I connected to it, not really knowing what was going on. 

Several prompts later, I had the first version of this website up and running on Github Pages. 

The actual coding happened in pretty much just two prompts, but there was lots about using Github and hosting websites that I didn’t know yet, so most of the prompts were to learn about master, branches, git pull, git push, PRs and merging, an evaluation of Github Pages vs Vercel vs Netlify for hosting, etc. But that’s another one of the coolest things I love about using Claude Code — it’s so easy to ask and learn the fundamental conceptual ideas that are needed to make progress, vs searching google and maybe finding something helpful, but definitely breaking the flow of work.

It took me a few more days to get my website to this final form that I’m happy with, basically popping onto the Claude app at night when I had some downtime for an hour or two and seeing how much I can (or it can, technically) accomplish just by asking. 

In the end, I’m amazed that I have a working website, and that I accomplished the whole thing from my phone, without ever opening a laptop or IDE.

It’s been about 15 years since I took my first intro to programming class in college and wrote my first Hello World program. The wonder, amazement and excitement of possibilities that I felt then has been sparked again. 

## Prompt Examples to Get Started on Your Own Website

These are actual prompts I used for getting Claude to build this website. Try them directly if you want to just see it in action, or use them as a starting point for your next idea:

> I want help with building a personal website to share my professional thoughts and projects im working on. There will be 3 sections: posts, projects, about. The style will be minimal, like Medium.

> Refactor this to use React

> Help me compare ux/ui design options. I want to see different styles so i can settle on a final style

> Help me update any files so that this website will work being hosted by vercel

And some prompts to learn about using Github and hosting websites:

> Help me understand how to use git and github. Explain repository, pull request, branches, and merging

> What are my options for hosting this website now that its in github
